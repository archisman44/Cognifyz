# 🔄 String Reversal – Python Script

This project is a simple Python program that takes user input and prints the reversed version of the string. The script runs in a continuous loop until the user types `exit`.

# String Reversal - Cognifyz Level 1 Task 1

---

## 🧪 How It Works

- The user is prompted to enter a string.
- The script reverses the string using Python slicing (`[::-1]`).
- The reversed string is displayed.
- The program then prompts for another string.
- To exit the program, the user can type `exit`.
